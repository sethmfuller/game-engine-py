# Game Engine - Python

## Overview

This engine is built upon Pygame.

## Main Constructs

### Scene

In general, every game will have one Scene instantiation. The Scene is where sprites will be placed and the main game loop occurs.
These are the basic features and properties that you can modify for the Scene:

- Screen
- size
- color
- `update()`
- `add_sprite()`
- `start()`
